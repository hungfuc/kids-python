Write a program that compares two strings given as input. Output the number of characters that match in each string position. The output should use the correct verb (match vs matches) according to the character count.

Ex: If the input is:
```
crash
crush
```
the output is:
```
4 characters match
```
Ex: If the input is:
```
cat
catnip
```
the output is:
```
3 characters match
```
Ex: If the input is:
```
mall
saw
```
the output is:
```
1 character matches
```
Ex: If the input is:
```
apple
orange
```
the output is:
```
0 characters match
```
