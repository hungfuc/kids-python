The program creates a random number from 1 to 10. We call it *target number*. <br />
Allow users to enter five times. <br />
- If the user enter a number larger than the *target number*, print "Your guess is too big!".
- If the user enter a number smaller than the *target number*, print "Your guess is too small!".
- When the guess is equal to the *target number*, print "Bingo, you win!!". Then, exit the program.
